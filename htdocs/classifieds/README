Mike's Classifieds
Version 1.1
--------------------------------------
mike@mikespice.com

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------
This is a free classifieds script to use on small to medium sites.
If you really would like to host a MAJOR classifieds site with 100,000 ads,
you need to pay me to write an SQL database version :)


DISTRIBUTION / LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------
This software is free to use and distribute.  You
may also make any changes that you want and distribute
it also.  The only thing that I ask is that you leave
the "provided by MikeSpice.com" with the link to 
my site www.mikespice.com in the generated HTML.
If you make changes, you may change it to something
like "provided by a MODIFIED script from mikespice.com"
or something of that nature.  The script is FREE, please
help me out!  Also, please email me if you use my 
script (just for kicks so I can see my stuff doing
good for people).

INSTALATION
--------------------------------------

Make sure that scripts that you run are run as you.  Some 
servers run CGI scripts as user "nobody".  This will NOT give you enough permissions
to modify the .dat files that this script creates.  The other option is to make 
the directory containing classifieds.cgi writable to all, this is a BAD idea
because it presents a security risk.  Check with your provider to make sure that
the scripts are run as YOU.

1. place the classifieds.cgi and sitevariables.pl in a folder under 
your cgi-bin along with any of the other files if you wish.
e.g. - cgi-bin/classifieds

2. switch to the folder where you put classifieds.cgi and 
chmod 755 classifieds.cgi

3. edit the sitevariables.pl to fit your needs (this way when new
versions come out, you can just replace the classifieds.cgi and
do not have to re-edit anything specific to your site). Unfortunatly
when going from version 1.0 to 1.1 you cannot just use your old one
due to the fact that there are two new variables.

4. place any pictures that you wish to use for your catagory
headings under a directory where your html files are stored
e.g. - www/classifieds/
Make sure that your sitevariables.pl file points to this (step 3)

4. there may be other permissions to set let me know if you have troubles

5. now just point your browser at
http://yourdomain/cgi-bin/classifieds/classifieds.cgi
or whereever you put it!

Good Liuck!  Email me if you use it!

FAQ
-------------------------------------
Q: The script only reads in the first or none of the catagories in my .dat file
A: This is probably due to the file locking call flock on WindowsNT servers.
Try commenting out all the lines that contain flock(anything) with a # at the 
begining of the line.

Q: The script complains that I do not have permissions to do such and such.
A: Make sure that scripts that you run are run as you.  Some 
servers run CGI scripts as user "nobody".  This will NOT give you enough permissions
to modify the .dat files that this script creates.  The other option is to make 
the directory containing classifieds.cgi writable to all, this is a BAD idea
because it presents a security risk.  Check with your provider to make sure that
the scripts are run as YOU.

Q: I get errors when I enable email
A: This may only work on UNIX/Linux servers (maybe not NT) or 
the path to sendmail may be incorrect.
Look at the mailme subroutine.  If you understand how it works,
you may need to just edit the path to sendmail.  I have no idea 
how it is done on a WinNT server.
