This is the source code for the Twin Cities Linux User Group (TCLUG),
hosted at http://www.mn-linux.org/ and http://www.tclug.org/.

the plan
========
1. decruft quickly
2. get all non-cruft into github
3. make the repo available for cloning & patching
4. fix obviously broken things
5. update the live site
6. make longer-term plans (w/ community involvement?)

possible features to implement
------------------------------
* RSS feed aggregator
* no RSS source until we have a reliable contributor
* portal / CMS (Drupal?)
