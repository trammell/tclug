the plan
========

1. decruft quickly
2. get all non-cruft into github
3. fix the obviously broken things about the site
4. make the repo available for cloning
5. make longer-term plans (w/ community involvement?)


possible features to implement
------------------------------
* RSS feed aggregator
* no RSS source until we have a reliable contributor
* portal / CMS (Drupal?)
